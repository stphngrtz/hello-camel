# Hello Apache Camel

I splitted this project into sub-projects to keep it clear and well structured.

- [getting-started](getting-started/) was my playground while diving into camel
- [custom-component](custom-component/) shows and describes how to create and use a custom component
- [performance-tests](performance-tests/) contains some simple camel routes which are to be measured
