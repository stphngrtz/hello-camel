# Getting started with Apache Camel

This project is based upon the [camel-archetype-java](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22camel-archetype-java%22) and gives an example of the following components:

- [camel-jetty](http://camel.apache.org/jetty.html)
- [camel-http4](http://camel.apache.org/http4.html)
- [camel-rabbitmq](http://camel.apache.org/rabbitmq.html)
- [activemq-camel:5.14.3](http://camel.apache.org/activemq.html)

I just got my hands dirty with Camel, please don't blame if I did any major mistakes. The examples are running but are not meant to be considered as best practice.

The [Apache Camel Tutorials by predic8](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_OwzAze_jNuX8efViuNobLeIPIOyFgjv) got me started, so yeah, thank you guys!
